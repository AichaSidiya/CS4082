## Machine Learning

# Course Overview

This course covered major machine learning concepts including the machine learning pipleine, and major machine learning models, in addition to some deep learning models. The following repisotory includes labs where I implemented some the the models we studied in Python, using mostly keras, tensorflow library. 
The models include:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-nearest-neighbour (KNN)
- Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
- Transfer Learning
